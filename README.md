We used NIHâ€™s BRB-ArrayTools software, developed by Dr. Richard Simon and the BRB-ArrayTools Development Team, to carry out a time course analysis on our iPSC-CM proteomic data using the plug-in provided in the software that finds the number of significant genes/proteins for testing time and class interactions. The results are based on fitting the following model: log expression ~ time + time2 + class + class * time + class * time2 (FDR <0.05). Proteins that were significantly different over time were compiled into an Excel spreadsheet linked to line plots. The line plots show protein abundance for the D65A cTnC mutant and wildtype as a function of time. 
Instructions: 
1. On Git Hub, click Code. 
3. Download zip.
4. Extract all. (Files will not open properly without this step.)
5. Open the Excel spreadsheet and click on the hyperlink in the lineplot link column to see how your protein of interest changes over time in both the D65A cTnC (non-contractile) cardiomyocytes and wildtype (contractile) cardiomyocytes.
